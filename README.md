Projects Regarding SNHU Courses

1: Project 2 Module Five is a program designed to calculate interest based on a given inintial value, along with a given interest rate, and number of years that the interest is allowed to accrue. 
2: I did well in creating the financeInfo class, using both public and private data to ensure that the program is modular and compartimentalized.
3: I could enhance my code by improving its organization and optimization, this would make it easier to be improved upon in the future, if another programmer ever needed to do so.
4: I found the functions for calculating interest the most difficult, since the syntax needed to be precise in order to work properly.  I used online resources as well as provided reading material to 
    find a structure that works.
5: The skills from this course that I think I will find most useful in the future is the ability to modularize programs with classes, to make software easier to understand and organize.
6: I used comments and tried to structure the program in such a way the the function of each section is clear, and is easily readable, adaptable, and maintainable in the future, rather than leaving it 
    to be a disorganized mess.
